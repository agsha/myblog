I finally setup my own blog! and i'm happy I did it the right way. No lame wordpress. I bought a virtual private server on [digitalocean](www.digitalocean.com). Virtual private server (or a droplet in digitalocean lingo) is a fancy name for your own computer in the cloud, which you can ssh into and have root access. It cost me ~Re 300 per month for their most basic droplet. I set it up with a static ipv4.

Since digitalocean has no DNS service, I bought a domain on [namecheap](www.namecheap.com) for Re 500 per year and pointed it to the droplet. I am hosting this as a static site powered by pelican. Using the built-in python server for now.
