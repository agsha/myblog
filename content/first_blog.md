Title: I finally setup a blog
disqus_identifier: my_blog

**I finally setup my own blog!** and i'm happy I did it the right way. No lame wordpress. I bought a virtual private server on [digital ocean](www.digitalocean.com). 

Virtual private server (or a droplet in digitalocean lingo) is a fancy name for your own computer in the cloud, which you can ssh into and have   root access. It cost me ~Re 300 per month for their most basic droplet. I set it up with a static ipv4.

Since digitalocean has no DNS service, I bought a domain on [namecheap](www.namecheap.com) for Re 500 per year and pointed it to the droplet. I   am hosting this as a static site powered by pelican. Using the built-in python server for now.  

**UPDATE (11th may 2016):** Paying monthly to digital ocean was getting to be a pain. So I have moved to github pages, which is just as simple.
