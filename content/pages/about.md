# Does the internet really need *another blog?*

In the Sci-Fi novel *Foundation*, Isaac Asimov describes an **Encyclopaedia Galactica**, which is an effort to document and catalog all of human knowledge, to prepare for the predicted downfall of the Galactic Empire.

My motivations for creating this blog is similar, but simpler in scope. I forget things. I would have spent a lot of time figuring out something, only to repeat the whole process again after a couple of months. *If only there was a summary of what I had learnt the last time round.*
